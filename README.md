# autoencoder-movie-rater
In this project, I aim to create a Stacked AutoEncoder (SAE) that can predict what rating a user will give to a movie. The original training set and test set contain ratings that users have given to different movies, where each record shows the rating that a certain user has given to a certain movie. This original data format is changed to be appropriate for the SAE. The SAE architecture is also implemented from scratch as a Python class. The project was developed with PyTorch, Pandas, Numpy, and Python.

Topics covered in this project are:
- Deep Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- AutoEncoders
